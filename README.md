## App for Flatacuties

This is a web application that allows users to vote for their favorite animal from a list of adorable animals. Each animal is represented by an image and a name, and users can click on their preferred animal to vote for it. The application fetches the animal names and details from a server and updates the vote count for each animal.


Here are some ideas for future improvements to enhance the app:

Saving Vote Data: Currently, the vote counts are stored temporarily and will reset if you refresh the page. To make the votes persistent, you could add a backend server and a database to store the data.
User Authentication: Implementing a user authentication system would allow you to track individual users' votes and prevent multiple votes from the same user.
Animations and Visual Effects: Adding animations and visual effects to the voting process could make the app more engaging and interactive.
Responsive Design: Improving the CSS styles to ensure that the app looks good and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
Feel free to implement these improvements or any other features that you think would enhance the app.
