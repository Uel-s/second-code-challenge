## Customization

You can customize the app by making changes to the following:

Animal Data: The information about the animals is stored in a JavaScript object in the script.js file. You can add or remove animals, or modify their details by editing the object.
Styling: If you want to change the appearance of the web page, you can modify the CSS rules in the style.css file.

## Future Improvements


Here are some ideas for future improvements to enhance the app:

Saving Vote Data: Currently, the vote counts are stored temporarily and will reset if you refresh the page. To make the votes persistent, you could add a backend server and a database to store the data.
User Authentication: Implementing a user authentication system would allow you to track individual users' votes and prevent multiple votes from the same user.
Animations and Visual Effects: Adding animations and visual effects to the voting process could make the app more engaging and interactive.
Responsive Design: Improving the CSS styles to ensure that the app looks good and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
Feel free to implement these improvements or any other features that you think would enhance the app.
